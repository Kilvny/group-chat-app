# Group chat app 

# Tech Stack:
- React JS for frontend 
- NodeJS/ Express for backend along with MongoDB
# My work included: 
- In a group chat app we want the messages to be updated instantly. This feature needs a real-time database which MongoDB is not
- Utilized PUSHER for the database to act as a real-time database
- The messages become almost instant
- Set up the client side for rendering the messages as well as the server side logic and the connection to mongoose Atlas database
